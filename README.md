DeepNetJ
========
ImageJ plugin for applying deep learning models to images.

I quite quickly abandonned this project after starting it (mostly due to difficulty to find the right way to integrate Java deep learning libraries with the ImageJ archiceture). I keep it here in case anyone wants a basic template for getting started with something like this.
